# Learning Roadmap – Agentic AI & Cloud 🚀

This roadmap outlines my structured learning path to transition from
cloud engineering into **Agentic AI and Generative AI**, with a focus on
automation, intelligent systems, and secure cloud integration.

The roadmap is flexible and will evolve as I learn and build.

---

## Phase 1: Foundations (Completed / In Progress)
🧠 Goal: Build strong conceptual understanding

- Basics of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)
- How LLMs work (tokens, prompts, context, embeddings)
- Prompt engineering fundamentals
- Overview of Agentic AI concepts
- Understanding tools, memory, and planning in AI agents

📌 Output:
- Notes and summaries
- Simple prompt experiments
- Concept documentation

---

## Phase 2: Tooling & Environment Setup
🛠 Goal: Get hands-on with AI tooling

- Python refresher for AI development
- Git & GitHub workflow
- Using LLM APIs (OpenAI / similar)
- LangChain / agent frameworks (intro level)
- Environment setup (virtual envs, secrets handling)

📌 Output:
- Small scripts
- API experiments
- Tool usage examples

---

## Phase 3: Simple AI Agents
🤖 Goal: Build basic working agents

- Single-task agents
- Tool-using agents
- Memory-enabled agents
- Prompt + tool orchestration
- Error handling and guardrails

📌 Output:
- Simple agent projects
- Documented experiments
- Reusable agent templates

---

## Phase 4: Agentic Workflows & Automation
⚙️ Goal: Apply agents to real use cases

- Multi-step agent workflows
- Task planning and execution
- AI agents for cloud automation
- AI-assisted monitoring or reporting
- Workflow orchestration concepts

📌 Output:
- Practical automation demos
- Cloud-focused agent use cases

---

## Phase 5: Cloud + AI Integration
☁️ Goal: Combine AI with cloud engineering skills

- Deploying AI agents in cloud environments
- Secure secrets & identity (IAM)
- API security and access control
- Cost awareness and optimization
- Logging, monitoring, and reliability

📌 Output:
- Cloud-deployed agent examples
- Secure AI architecture patterns

---

## Phase 6: Advanced Concepts (Future)
🚀 Goal: Move towards production-ready thinking

- Multi-agent systems
- Agent collaboration and coordination
- Evaluation and testing of AI agents
- Responsible AI and safety
- Scaling and performance considerations

📌 Output:
- Advanced experiments
- Architecture documentation

---

## Continuous Goals
📈 Ongoing focus throughout the journey

- Consistent commits and documentation
- Clean README files for every project
- Learning by building, not just reading
- Sharing progress publicly on GitHub
